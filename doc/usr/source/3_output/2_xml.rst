JSON / XML Output
=================

Kind 2 can output its results in two structured formats: JSON and XML.

The JSON output is activated by running Kind 2 with the ``-json`` option, and it is
fully specified by the JSON schema available in `kind2-output.json <https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/blob/develop/schemas/kind2-output.json>`_.

The XML output is activated by running Kind 2 with the ``-xml`` option, and it is
fully specified by the XML schema available in `kind2-output.xsd <https://github.com/kind2-mc/kind2/blob/develop/schemas/kind2-output.xsd>`_.
